            IAT 359: Mobile Computing was a class centered around the design and development of mobile apps. All of the 
            work was coded on Java for Android devices. For the course project, my partner and I created a music guessing 
            game that followed the project’s criteria while expanding our skillset with integration with the Spotify API.

        <h3 class="container-item">Spotify Integration</h3>

        <p class="container-item">
            After a strong initial idea, my partner took it a step further and we proceeded to work with the Spotify API with 
            our app. This provided our app with many different utilities including music streaming, search functions for songs 
            and artists, and temporary storing of the selected songs. With our minimal experience with APIs and the Android 
            Studio framework, we struggled to put our plans into motion early on. Setup and authentication made it difficult 
            to start. Additionally, finding a balance between the project’s requirements and our needs to make it work were 
            tricky and took many iterations over time.

        <h3 class="container-item">Design and UI</h3>

        <p class="container-item">
            As per the criteria, we had to use a recycler view (a list of objects) so we wanted to design something pleasing yet 
            functional instead of a rectangle. Mockups were made for both the player list and the song search that appropriately 
            matched our colour palette and theme. We also put some creative thought into the guessing part of the game, utilizing 
            a circular progress bar wrapping around the player’s image showcasing the song’s duration.

        <p class="container-item"> Overall, this project introduced a new environment for coding and function with Android Studio 
            and the Spotify API. Despite the rough start, we were successfully able to accomplish our goal. I was also able to 
            implement some design work in the app’s UI creating a usable and appropriate interface.
